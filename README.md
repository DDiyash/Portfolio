2. Cyclistic-bike-share is a case study to analyze the number of casual riders and members to gain insights on how both users use bikes differently to create proper plans on converting casual riders to members. I have used excel and pandas and added visualizations(charts) using pivot tables in case of excel and seaborn and matplotlib in case of pandas. I have created pivot table for excel of every month, a sample is added in result_images folder along with charts present in jupyter notebook file. This project was done to explore and gain an understanding on excel and to understand concatenation of many large files into a csv file using pandas.I could draw conclusions and few patterns and based on this I was able to recommend 3 solutions which is mentioned in report.
